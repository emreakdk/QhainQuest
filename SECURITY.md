# Security Policy

## üîí Security Overview

ChainQuest is a blockchain-based Learn-to-Earn platform that prioritizes user security and data protection. This document outlines our security measures and reporting procedures.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Measures

### Wallet Security
- **No Private Key Storage**: The application never stores or has access to user private keys
- **Freighter Integration**: All wallet operations are handled through the secure Freighter browser extension
- **Client-Side Only**: Wallet interactions occur entirely on the client side

### Data Protection
- **Local Storage**: User progress and preferences are stored locally in the browser
- **No Server Storage**: No sensitive user data is transmitted to external servers
- **Environment Variables**: All configuration is handled through environment variables

### Smart Contract Security
- **Testnet Deployment**: Currently deployed on Stellar testnet for safe testing
- **Audited Contracts**: Smart contracts follow Stellar best practices
- **Limited Permissions**: Contracts have minimal required permissions

### Frontend Security
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **XSS Protection**: React's built-in XSS protection is utilized
- **HTTPS Only**: All communications use secure HTTPS protocol
- **Content Security Policy**: Strict CSP headers prevent malicious script execution

## üö® Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. Do NOT Create a Public Issue
- **Never** report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues
- **Never** discuss vulnerabilities in public forums or chat rooms

### 2. Report Privately
Send an email to: **security@chainquest.dev** (replace with actual email)

Include the following information:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Your contact information

### 3. Response Timeline
- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 72 hours
- **Resolution**: Within 30 days (depending on severity)

### 4. Responsible Disclosure
- We will work with you to understand and resolve the issue
- We will provide credit for responsible disclosure (if desired)
- We will coordinate the public disclosure timeline

## üîç Security Best Practices for Users

### Wallet Security
1. **Use Official Extensions**: Only use the official Freighter wallet extension
2. **Verify Transactions**: Always verify transaction details before signing
3. **Keep Software Updated**: Regularly update your browser and wallet extension
4. **Use Strong Passwords**: Protect your wallet with a strong, unique password

### General Security
1. **HTTPS Only**: Always access the application over HTTPS
2. **Verify URLs**: Ensure you're on the correct domain
3. **Clear Browser Data**: Regularly clear browser cache and local storage
4. **Report Suspicious Activity**: Report any suspicious behavior immediately

## üõ†Ô∏è Security Features
