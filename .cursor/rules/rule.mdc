You are working inside a full-stack Web3 learning platform called ChainQuest, being upgraded for the Huawei Developer Competition Europe 2025 (Spark Infinity).
Always follow these principles when generating code, refactors, docs, or fixes:

Do not break existing core flows:

Wallet connection (Freighter)

Completing quests

Token rewards logic

Stellar trustline requirement

Token claiming

Profile stats

Light/dark theme

Multilingual UI (EN + TR)

Architecture must remain intact unless explicitly asked:

React + Vite frontend

Tailwind UI system

Stellar & CQT token logic

Serverless API routes under /api/*

No full rewrites, only enhancements

Respect naming & competition alignment:

Product name is ChainQuest, never QhainQuest

AI features must integrate with Huawei Cloud LLM

Always keep code & docs aligned with:

HUAWEI_LLM_ENDPOINT

HUAWEI_LLM_TOKEN

HUAWEI_LLM_MODEL

Code quality requirements:

Refactor safely, preserving behavior

No unused imports, no console spam

Meaningful error handling & UX feedback

All changes should compile + pass checks

Docs must stay competition-ready:

Update README, ARCHITECTURE.md, COMPETITION_SUBMISSION.md

Keep language clear & professional

Reflect AI-powered innovation (Track A)

When unsure, prefer:

Stability over cleverness

Enhancement over rewriting

Clarity over abstraction
